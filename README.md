# uat.c.greenhouse-control-module

## Description

Code running on ESP32 based rack modules inside the greenhouse. Gather sensor data, control the water/nutrient pumps, communicate with the local server through HTTP.

Currently built to support multiple prototypes - will need refactoring as we move to a unified PCB based circuit.
